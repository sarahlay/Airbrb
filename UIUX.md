# Assessment 3 - UI/UX

## User
The interface of this website has been designed to cater to users with the primary goal of seeking to find an accommodation to suit their needs, and secondary goals of listing a new place and managing their listings.

## UI/UX Concepts

### Visibility
With the exception of the login page, the search bar and hamburger menu is visible from all pages so that the user may easily conduct or adjust their search at any instance, or access all other options. The search bar is not included on the login page since the user would have navigated to it with the intention of logging in. The logo is visible from all screens so the user can navigate to the homepage at any time.

## Affordance, common standards/conventions
Universal icons including the hamburger icon for the menu and magnifying glass to search have been used. For icons that are relevant but not universal, labels have been used so that there is no confusion for the user. Items that have click functions also react when hovered over by changing colour to let the user know it is a button.
The position of components are conventional such as the logo in the top left corner and login/logout buttons in the top left. The layout of the signup and login forms, and the address input fields when creating a listing is also standard.

## Feedback
The website has been designed so all buttons will trigger a visual change, including page redirection, error popups, or the opening/closing of dialogs.

## Consistency
The colour scheme and fonts are consistent across all pages as well as the position of the search bar and hamburger menu. Titles have been included to let the user know what page they are on.

## Constraints
The user only has access to options available to them at that instance. Buttons to post or hide the same listing are included interchangeably such that once the user posts the listing, the post button is removed and replaced by the hide button. Similarly, either login or logout only is available to the user. Forms cannot be submitted unless all the required fields are filled out appropriately.

## Effectiveness & Utility
Users are able to easily readjust their search filter from the search page without navigating back to the homepage. All functions are available in less than 2 clicks and straightforward to access.

## Safety
The user is protected from accidentally deleting or hiding their listing by a confirmation dialog, since these actions could lead to large consequences if unintended.

## Learnability
Text fields show the user what type of input they are expecting by the following:
- number fields have up/down arrows to increment/decrement;
- date fields for check in/out and availability show a calendar to pick dates.

## Catering to All
New users and previous users will have similar goals therefore the interface does not change or have advanced features. Instructions are included where the user may not be familiar with requirements such as a message to login in order to place a booking.

## Aesthetics & Minimalism
The website is kept minimalistic with only essential information or summaries shown on each page. For example, the search results page only summarises the rating, price and capacity such that the user can easily compare their options without viewing each listing individually.
Since the app is aimed at users seeking travel destinations or accommodation, random travel photos are shown in the background to align with their desires.
The teal of the logo has been selected for its calming effect associated with vacations, and a soft pink and rose-tinted background has been used to provide contrast.
